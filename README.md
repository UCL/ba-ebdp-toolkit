# ebdp-lightweight

Lightweight modelling workflow for EBDP TWIN2EXPAND project for evidence based approaches to urban design and planning.

## Development

Project configuration is managed using a `pyproject.toml` file. For development purposes: `uv` is used for installation and management of the packages and related upgrades. For example: `uv sync` will install packages listed in the `pyproject.toml` file and creates a self-contained development environment in a `.venv` folder.

## Data Loading

See the [data_loading.md](data_loading.md) markdown file for data loading guidelines.

## Licenses

This repo depends on copy-left open source packages licensed as AGPLv3 and therefore adopts the same license. This is also in keeping with the intention of the TWIN2EXPAND project to create openly reproducible workflows.
